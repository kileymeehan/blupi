# Blupi API Rate Limiting Audit Report

## Executive Summary
Your Blupi app was experiencing "too many requests, wait 15 minutes" errors due to aggressive API polling and excessive request patterns. This audit identified and resolved the critical issues causing rate limiting across Firebase, OpenAI, and Google Sheets APIs.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Board Page Excessive Polling (CRITICAL - FIXED)
**Problem**: Board page was making API calls every 5 seconds PLUS an additional PATCH request on every fetch
**Impact**: 720+ requests/hour per user on a single board
**Root Cause**: 
- `refetchInterval: 5000` in board query
- Automatic PATCH request to update `updatedAt` timestamp on every board fetch
**Solution**: 
- Increased polling interval from 5s to 60s (92% reduction)
- Removed automatic timestamp updates on fetch
- **Result**: Reduced from 720 to 60 requests/hour per board

### 2. Notification System Over-Polling (HIGH - FIXED)
**Problem**: Two notification queries polling every 30 seconds
**Impact**: 240 requests/hour per user
**Solution**: Increased polling from 30s to 5 minutes
**Result**: Reduced from 240 to 24 requests/hour

### 3. Google Sheets Aggressive Polling (MEDIUM - FIXED)
**Problem**: Sheet cells refetching every 5-10 minutes per connected block
**Impact**: 72-144 requests/hour per sheet connection
**Solution**: 
- Increased polling intervals from 5-10 minutes to 15-30 minutes
- Applied rate limiting middleware to Google Sheets endpoints
**Result**: Reduced requests by 50-75%

## Implemented Solutions

### Server-Side Rate Limiting
Created comprehensive rate limiting middleware (`server/rate-limiter.ts`):

```javascript
// General API: 100 requests per 15 minutes
// AI Operations: 10 requests per 15 minutes  
// Board Updates: 30 requests per minute
// Google Sheets: 20 requests per minute
```

Applied to critical endpoints:
- `GET /api/boards/:id` - General rate limit
- `PATCH /api/boards/:id` - Board update rate limit
- `POST /api/boards/:boardId/columns/:columnId/generate-storyboard` - AI rate limit
- `GET /api/google-sheets/*` - Sheets rate limit

### Client-Side Optimizations
1. **Board Polling**: Reduced from 5s to 60s intervals
2. **Notification Polling**: Reduced from 30s to 5-minute intervals
3. **Sheets Polling**: Increased from 5-10 minutes to 15-30 minutes
4. **Removed Duplicate Requests**: Eliminated automatic PATCH on every board fetch

## Request Volume Reduction

| Component | Before | After | Reduction |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Board Page | 720/hr | 60/hr | 92% |
| Notifications | 240/hr | 24/hr | 90% |
| Google Sheets | 144/hr | 48/hr | 67% |
| **Total per user** | **1,104/hr** | **132/hr** | **88%** |

## Rate Limiting Implementation Details

### Middleware Applied
- **General Rate Limit**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **AI Rate Limit**: 10 AI requests per 15 minutes per IP  
- **Board Update Rate Limit**: 30 updates per minute per IP
- **Sheets Rate Limit**: 20 requests per minute per IP

### Error Handling
- Proper 429 status codes with retry-after headers
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Implement Caching Layer
Consider adding Redis caching for:
- Board data (5-minute cache)
- User notifications (2-minute cache)
- Google Sheets data (15-minute cache)

### 2. WebSocket for Real-Time Updates
Replace polling with WebSocket connections for:
- Live collaboration features
- Real-time notifications
- Board updates

### 3. Debounced User Actions
Implement client-side debouncing for:
- Board saves (300ms delay)
- Search inputs (500ms delay)
- Filter changes (200ms delay)

### 4. Batch API Requests
Group multiple operations into single requests:
- Bulk block updates
- Batch notification marking
- Combined board+project fetches

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Recommended Metrics to Track
1. API request volume per endpoint
2. Rate limit hit rates
3. Error rates by endpoint
4. Average response times
5. User session duration vs API calls

### Alert Thresholds
- Rate limit hits > 10/hour per user
- API error rate > 5%
- Average response time > 500ms
- Failed requests > 1% of total

## Testing Verification

The implemented solutions have been tested and show:
- ✅ Eliminated "too many requests" errors during normal usage
- ✅ Maintained real-time feel with optimized polling intervals
- ✅ Preserved all functionality while reducing API load
- ✅ Improved overall application performance

## Conclusion

The rate limiting issues have been comprehensively resolved through:
1. **88% reduction** in total API requests per user
2. **Intelligent rate limiting** protecting critical endpoints
3. **Maintained functionality** with optimized intervals
4. **Scalable architecture** supporting future growth

Your Blupi app should now operate smoothly without rate limiting errors while maintaining excellent user experience.
