BLUPI - UNFINISHED FEATURES TRACKER
===================================

This document tracks features that have been started but are not yet fully implemented or working in the application.

PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:
-------------------------------

1. PDF WORKFLOW IMPORT
   Status: Removed from UI (incomplete backend implementation)
   Description: Feature to upload PDF files and automatically extract workflow steps as individual image blocks
   What's Done:
   - Backend PDF processing logic with pdf2pic library
   - Individual page extraction to PNG images
   - Basic workflow step creation structure
   - Server endpoints for PDF upload and processing
   What's Missing:
   - Working PDF to image conversion (pdf2pic integration issues)
   - Error handling for malformed PDFs
   - Image optimization and sizing
   - UI integration (currently removed)
   Next Steps: Fix pdf2pic library integration, test with various PDF formats

2. FIREBASE AUTHENTICATION ERRORS
   Status: Console errors present but basic functionality works
   Description: JavaScript module loading errors in browser console related to Firebase imports
   What's Done:
   - Firebase configuration and secrets setup
   - Basic authentication flow structure
   What's Missing:
   - Resolve module import errors in browser console
   - Clean up Firebase initialization warnings
   Next Steps: Debug import issues, verify Firebase configuration

3. BULK EDIT FUNCTIONALITY
   Status: Partially working with minor issues
   Description: Select multiple blocks and perform bulk operations
   What's Done:
   - Bulk edit mode toggle
   - Block selection with checkboxes
   - Bulk delete functionality
   - Undo system for bulk operations
   What's Missing:
   - Bulk type changes
   - Bulk department/category changes
   - Improved visual feedback during bulk operations
   Next Steps: Complete remaining bulk operations

4. AI-POWERED CONTENT CLASSIFICATION
   Status: Basic implementation with emoji removal needed
   Description: Automatically classify imported content and assign appropriate block types
   What's Done:
   - OpenAI integration for content analysis
   - Basic classification logic
   - CSV import with AI classification
   What's Missing:
   - Remove automatic emoji assignment (user request)
   - Improve classification accuracy
   - Handle edge cases and errors gracefully
   Next Steps: Update AI classifier to remove emoji assignment

FEATURES MENTIONED BUT NOT STARTED:
-----------------------------------

1. Advanced PDF Processing
   - OCR for text extraction from scanned PDFs
   - Smart content recognition (forms, diagrams, screenshots)
   - Automatic workflow step numbering detection

2. Enhanced Google Sheets Integration
   - Real-time data synchronization
   - Bi-directional data flow
   - Advanced metrics and calculations

3. Collaboration Features
   - Real-time cursor tracking
   - Voice/video chat integration
   - Advanced permission management

4. Export/Import Enhancements
   - Multiple export formats (Word, PowerPoint, etc.)
   - Template system for common workflows
   - Bulk import from various sources

5. Advanced Analytics
   - Workflow performance metrics
   - User engagement tracking
   - Process optimization suggestions

TECHNICAL DEBT TO ADDRESS:
--------------------------

1. TypeScript Errors
   - Multiple type mismatches in board-grid.tsx
   - Department enum constraints
   - Attachment interface inconsistencies

2. Error Handling
   - Inconsistent error handling patterns
   - Missing try-catch blocks in some async operations
   - User-facing error messages need improvement

3. Performance Optimizations
   - Large board rendering optimization
   - Image loading and caching improvements
   - WebSocket connection management

NOTES:
------
- PDF workflow import was removed from UI due to implementation issues
- Focus on completing existing features before adding new ones
- Prioritize user-requested changes and bug fixes
- Maintain documentation as features are completed or modified
